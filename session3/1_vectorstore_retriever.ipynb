    "# How to use a vectorstore as a retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector store retriever is a [retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers/) that uses a [vector store](/docs/concepts/vectorstores/) to retrieve documents. It is a lightweight wrapper around the vector store class to make it conform to the retriever [interface](/docs/concepts/runnables/).\n",
    "It uses the search methods implemented by a vector store, like similarity search and MMR, to query the texts in the vector store.\n",

    "In this guide we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to instantiate a retriever from a vectorstore;\n",
    "2. How to specify the search type for the retriever;\n",

    "Cosine similarity ranges from -1 (completely opposite) to 1 (identical direction), with 0 indicating orthogonality (no similarity).\n",

Sacrifices that we and our allies are making impose upon us all a sacred obligation to see to it that out of this war we and our children will gain something better than mere survival. We are united in determination that this war shall not be followed by another interim which leads to new disaster- that we shall not repeat the tragic errors of ostrich isolationismâ€”that we shall not repeat the excesses of the wild twenties when this Nation went for a joy ride on a roller coaster which ended in a tragic crash. When Mr. Hull went to Moscow in October, and when I went to Cairo and Teheran in November, we knew that we were in agreement with our allies in our common determination to fight and win this war. But there were many vital questions concerning the future peace, and they were discussed in an atmosphere of complete candor and harmony. In the last war such discussions, such meetings, did not even begin until the shooting had stopped and the delegates began to assemble at the peace table. There had been no previous opportunities for man-to-man discussions which lead to meetings of minds. The result was a peace which was not a peace. That was a mistake which we are not repeating in this war.\n"
